Simple HTML CSS Js covid Tracker
This one is my first Api project and probably the first
Repository on GitHub I don't know anyone is even
Interested on this shit but it is what it is so
Yeah, anyways whoever see this code I'm looking
Forward to him/her that they'll write some better
CSS for this one cus I don't have any idea how it's
Going to look on different devices "PS:- I code this
On my phone" so help me to improve this one guys
/* TBH I know I'm talking to myself but this feel
So good I know no one's ever gonna going to see this
But still as a memory I'm writing this README*/

Anyways still if someone find this shit by any
Chance I'm looking forward to him that they'll
Sure gonna write some better CSS.

PEACE OUT ಥ‿ಥ
